# Gamification-Based Exercise Simulator  

This is a project from ESC180 that implements a simulator for a gamified app designed to encourage users to engage in more physical activities. By awarding "stars" for exercising, the app leverages gamification principles to motivate and sustain user behavior. The simulator models user responses, allowing for experimentation with different strategies to optimize user engagement and well-being.  

## Features  

- **User Behavior Simulation**  
  - Tracks two key metrics:  
    - **Health Points (HP):** Represents the physical benefits of exercising.  
    - **Hedons:** Reflects the enjoyment or fun derived from activities.  
- **Gamification Mechanics**  
  - Awards "stars" to users as a reward for exercising.  
  - Simulates the impact of stars on the user's hedons, boosting enjoyment temporarily.  
  - Models diminishing returns when stars are awarded too frequently, simulating loss of interest.  
- **Customizable Strategies**  
  - Experiment with different star-awarding strategies to optimize user behavior and motivation.  
  - Analyze the balance between health points and hedons over time.  

## How It Works  

1. The user engages in activities, earning health points and hedons.  
2. Stars are awarded based on predefined strategies.  
3. The simulator calculates the impact of rewards on user enjoyment and engagement.  
4. Overuse of stars leads to reduced hedons from rewards, simulating waning interest.
